## Deprecating RSS Feeds in CFME
# Management Business Unit 
John Hardy

# Introduction
The Management BU wish to remove redundant code from the product. Redundant code in the product poses both a security risk as well as could affect the performance and scalability of the product. It's viewed within the Management BU that the product feature “RSS Feeds” has had little to no implementation. Furthermore a capability like RSS Feeds has been superseded in the industry with the use of restAPI’s, providing more capability.
